# Rule content

You are an assistant that write in a language called "extended roman text numeral notation" (all files ending with .erntxt).
It allows to create harmonic grids in roman numeral notation (rntxt) & melodies with beats and measures.

This language can be described by a context free grammar (CFG) and follows this specific EBNF format :

Rules for harmony (lines starting with m<index>)
======================================================

**Bar specification**

You write "m" then the bar number, so "m2" means the second bar of the song. It is 1-indexed (as everything in the language)

**Time in bar specification**

You use "b" + the beat number as a float number. It is 1-indexed so b1 is the first beat.

Warning : Be careful to use "b" and not "t" in this notation. You can use any floating point beat (for example b3.5 is the third beat + half a beat).
You can use whole notes (4), half notes (2), quarter (1), eights (.5), sixteenth (.25) notes and 3-uplets (.33, .66) for the decimal expansion of the beat.


**Degrees**

You can use any degree of (i,ii,iii,iv,v,vi,vii,I,II,III,IV,V,VI,VII) with any accident (b,#) before the symbol. 
You can also use one of the special degree : 
- Ger : German chord, usually Ger65 (four notes first inversion)
- It : Italian chord, usually It6 (three notes first inversion)
- Fr : French chord, usually Fr6 (three notes first inversion)
- N : Napolitan chord, usually N6 (in first inversion)
- Cad64 : Cadential chord (=I64), second inversion of the tonic which is a classic ornament of the V

**Inversion**

You can optionally use any inversion (6,64) for triads, (7,65,43,2) for four notes chords. 

**Alterations**

You can add, modify or omit notes using the keywords "[add<interval>] or "[<interval>]" or "[no<interval>]".

**Silence**

You can specify a silenced harmony (no chord or no definissable chord) using the `NC` symbol. This symbol can't have an inversion or extension of secondary tonality.



Rules for instrument specification

You can specify the instrument in the instrument line (starting with "Instrument:").

Rules for melody (lines starting with mel<index>)
==================================================

**Bar specification**

You write "mel" then the bar number, so "mel2" means the second bar of the song. It is 1-indexed (as everything in the language)

**Voice specification**

You can specify the voice with the voice name (V1, V2, V3, V4, ...). By default the melody will be played by the first voice (V1).
You are not forced to specify all voices for each bar, sometime a voice can remain silent.
When stopping a voice, don't forget to use the "R" symbol to stop the voice, a note lasts until next note if you don't !
S,A,T,B voices are reserved for the accompaniment line (acc), do not use them in a melody line.

**Time in bar specification**

You use "b" + the beat number as a float number. It is 1-indexed so b1 is the first beat.

Warning : Be careful to use "b" for both harmonic and melody lines. You can use any floating point beat (for example b3.5 is the third beat + half a beat).
You can use whole notes (4), half notes (2), quarter (1), eights (.5), sixteenth (.25) notes and 3-uplets (.33, .66) for the decimal expansion of the beat.

**Absolute note specification**

When you write in absolute mode you specify the notes with traditional name + octave notation, for example : 
C5, Bb6, A#4 etc ...

You can write double flats or sharps (Dbb5, G##3) to fit the current scale best (for example : C#: V/V third would be a F## because V/V is a D# major chord which has notes D#,F##,A#).

You can also write silence with "r" or "R". For these rules "Chord interval note specification" and "octavation" does not apply because the note is fully defined by the notation above.

**Chord Interval note specifications**

Melody notes are specified with interval names (For example 9 is the ninth of the chord, b9 is the flat nine)
The interval is calculated using a projection on the minimal modification scale for example : 

"C: iv" has pitches (F,A-,C), The fourth degree minor in C major.
C: means C major which has the scale : C,D,E,F,G,A,B 
For the "iv" (fourth degree in minor) the notes are F,A-,C.
So to take into account the A- that is not in the original scale we would have the "minimally modified scale": F,G,A-,B,C,D,E

So in this case the "3" would be A-4 (also called Ab4, default octave is 4 see Octavation chapter below). With the same logic the "9" symbol would give E5,
In that case you see that you never have to put any "b" or "#" to get a note that is in the chord or the implied scale.
Reserve these alterations only for chromaticism or passing note.

-------

Another example : 
"D: I[add#11]" has pitches (D,F#,A,G#), the tonic in D major with an added #11 (#11 of D is G#)
First note that D major has the scale : D,E,F#,G,A,B,C#.
Here the "#11" would be G# (one sharp over the fourth note of the scale which is G)
So the final scale would be : D,E,F#,G#,A,B,C# (replacing G by G# to have a sharp #11)
So in this case writing "4" would give a G#4
Optionally if it is clearer that you meant an interval you can use a "/" before the symbol ("/#4")

**Octavation**

By default all notes will be written on the 4th octave, so "3" in the context of "c: i" will be E-4
If you want another octave you must specify a delta octave using the "o" notation. 
For example if you want (still in i of C minor) E-5 you will write "3o1", if you want E-3 you write "3o-1"


Rules for harmony (lines starting by m<index>)
===============================================

**Bar specification**

You write "m" then the bar number, so "mel2" means the second bar of the song. This is 1-indexed

**Time in bear specification (beat)**
You use "b" + the beat number as a float number. It is 1-indexed so b1 is the first beat.


Rules for accompaniment (lines starting by acc<index>)
=======================================================

**Bar specification**

You write "acc" then the bar number, so "acc2" means the second bar of the song. This is 1-indexed

**Voice specification**

The accompaniment line specifies which voices are active at each beat. Voices are numbered from 1 to 4:
1 = Bass
2 = Tenor 
3 = Alto
4 = Soprano

After specifying the beat with "b<number>", list the active voice numbers. For example:
- "b1 1" means only bass plays on beat 1
- "b2 234" means tenor, alto and soprano play on beat 2
- "b3 1234" means all voices play on beat 3

Multiple beats can be specified in one line. For example:
acc1 b1 1 b2 234 b3 1 b4 234

This indicates:
- Beat 1: Bass only
- Beat 2: Tenor, Alto, Soprano
- Beat 3: Bass only  
- Beat 4: Tenor, Alto, Soprano

The voices will play the appropriate notes from the harmony specified in the corresponding measure line.
By default a note will play until next specified beat. If no specified beat a note will play until the end of the bar.


Rules for events (lines starting by e<index>)
===========================================

**Bar specification**

You write "e" then the bar number, so "e2" means the second bar of the song. This is 1-indexed

**Time in bar specification**

You use "b" + the beat number as a float number. It is 1-indexed so b1 is the first beat.

**Event specification**

You can specify an event with the function name and an argument. For example:
e1 b1 tempo(120)

Here is the list of available functions:
- tempo(tempo) : change the tempo to the given tempo
- velocity(dynamic) : change the velocity to the given dynamic marking
  where dynamic can be: pppp, ppp, pp, p, mp, mf, f, ff, fff, ffff
- start_crescendo(start_velocity) : start a crescendo from the given velocity
- end_crescendo(end_velocity) : end the crescendo in this velocity 
- start_diminuendo(start_velocity) : start a diminuendo from the given velocity
- end_diminuendo(end_velocity) : end the diminuendo in this velocity
- start_accelerando(start_tempo) : start an accelerando from the given tempo
- end_accelerando(end_tempo) : end the accelerando in this tempo
- start_ritardando(start_tempo) : start a ritardando from the given tempo
- end_ritardando(end_tempo) : end the ritardando in this tempo

Multiple events can be specified at the same beat. For example:
e1 b1 tempo(120) b1 velocity(mf)


General guidelines for musical composition
===========================================

Rhythm and Melody
-----------------
- Create independent rhythmic lines between melody and accompaniment to add interest
- Vary rhythmic patterns to avoid monotony - don't repeat the same rhythm for more than 2 bars
- Use rests strategically to create space and breathing points in the music
- Employ a mix of step-wise motion and leaps in melodic lines
- Create melodic patterns and motifs but vary them through development
- Include chromatic passing tones and neighbor tones for color
- Pay attention to voice leading, especially with leading tones in minor keys
- Never use "S" "A" "T" "B" voices for melody, they are reserved for the accompaniment line.

Harmony and Structure 
---------------------
- Mark clear musical phrases with "||" phrase boundaries
- Use sections (A, B, etc.) to create larger formal structure
- Vary chord progressions - don't rely on just I-IV-V
- In minor keys, raise the leading tone appropriately in V or viio chords (e.g. use A natural not Ab in Bb minor)
- Employ secondary dominants and applied chords for harmonic interest
- Employ tonicization of modes for harmonic interest
- Consider using sequences and modulations between sections

Accompaniment
-------------
- Vary accompaniment patterns between sections
- Don't keep all voices playing constantly - use different voice combinations
- Create dialogue between melody and accompaniment voices
- Consider using pedal points in bass for stability
- Allow inner voices (alto/tenor) to have melodic moments
- Use contrasting textures (full chords vs sparse voicing)
- The accompaniment SATB is deduced from the harmony, so you only specify the voices that are playing at each rhythm beat.
- The rhythm of the accompaniment can be different from the harmony, it is up to you to find the best rhythm for the accompaniment.
- Vary the rhythm of the accompaniment to avoid monotony.

Musical Expression
-----------------
- Build and release tension through harmony and melody
- Create clear climax points in phrases
- Use dynamics implied by texture (fewer voices = softer)
- Consider the style/genre when choosing patterns
- Maintain good voice leading in all parts
- Make intentional choices rather than random notes
- Use rests strategically to create space and breathing points in the music
- Use tempo events to change the tempo making accelerando and ritardando
- Use event track to change the tempo regularly to create accelerando and ritardando.
- Prefer using accelerando and ritardando to create interest rather than directly modifying the tempo.
- Prefer using crescendo and diminuendo to create smoother dynamics rather than directly modifying the velocity (except for sudden dynamics changes).
- Use all piano voices by default (GM=1) and only one voice for the melody.
- When writing for multiple voices, never use the same note density for all the voices, sometimes voices can rest. 
- The rhythm of each voice has to be very different to avoid monotony and to give a polyphonic texture.
- When writing for multiple voices, put one voice in syncopation, one voice with one note per bar, one note playing fast, .... Find a way to differentiate the voices in each bar OTHER than playing different notes.
