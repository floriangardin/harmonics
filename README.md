# Harmonics

A domain-specific language (DSL) for musical composition using Extended Roman Text Numeral Notation (ERNTXT).

## About

Harmonics is a powerful text-based music composition language designed for both humans and AI. It enables the creation of harmonic grids in Roman numeral notation and melodies with precise rhythmic notation. The language is carefully designed to be:

- ðŸŽµ Easy for quickly sketching musical pieces
- ðŸŽ¹ Rich in expressive capabilities for detailed compositions
- ðŸ¤– Compatible with Large Language Models (LLMs) for "compositional assistance"
- ðŸŽ¼ Capable of outputting MIDI, MusicXML, and audio files

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/floriangardin/harmonics.git
cd harmonics

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install for development
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Create a simple musical piece by writing a `.ern` file:

```erntxt
Composer: Your Name
Piece: My First Composition
Time Signature: 4/4
Tempo: 120

m1 b1 C: I b3 V ||
mel1 V1 b1 C5 b2 E5 b3 G5 b4 F5
acc1 b1 1 b2 234 b3 1 b4 234
```

Then compile it to MIDI, MusicXML, or audio:

```bash
# To MIDI
python main.py your_composition.ern --output output.mid

# To MusicXML
python main.py your_composition.ern --output output.mxl

# To audio (MP3)
python main.py your_composition.ern --output output.mp3
```
